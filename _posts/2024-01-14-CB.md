<em>
Match report - Sunday 14 January. 

<em>
In this week's touch rugby escapade, John managed to outscore everyone, proving once again that even a hangover can't slow down his try-scoring spree. Gevine gave him a good run for his money, but John held onto his title like it was the last beer at the after-party.

<em>
Ferdi brought his pint-sized prodigy to the field, and to everyone's surprise, the young lad scored a try on his debut. However, he didn't hesitate to give his old man a piece of his mind for not passing when he was wide open on the wing – parenting lessons on and off the field for Ferdi.

<em>
In the recurring saga of weekly tantrums, another player stormed off early, leaving the team to wonder if touch rugby might need a designated "timeout" area. Meanwhile, Dale, fueled by the romantic escapades of the previous night, showcased a performance that hinted at a different kind of pre-match warm-up.

<em>
Stinky, making a rare appearance, almost clinched the delicate desert flower award but somehow managed to hang in there, avoiding the dubious honor. Graham, the perpetual try-shy player, continued his streak of not scoring any tries, although he did reminisce about his glorious three-try performance two weeks ago – a distant memory for the rest of the team.

<em>
Man of the match honors went to Shak, who dazzled everyone with his moves on the field, proving once again that in the world of touch rugby, Shak is the maestro orchestrating the comedic symphony of tries, tantrums, and tales of the night before. Meanwhile, Timmy, unable to find his pants because his wife wears the pants in their relationship, regretfully missed the entire spectacle, adding a touch of domestic disarray to the mix.
